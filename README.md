Challenge: Create a reusable input with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

User story: I can see error state
User story: I can choose to disable input
User story: I can choose to have helper text
User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
User story: I can have different input sizes
User story: I can have different colors
User story: I can choose to have input take the width of the parent
User story: I can have multiline input like a textarea
User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
User story: I can still access all input attributes
User story (optional): Show input in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the input in multiple states is enough

Tech: VueJS.
